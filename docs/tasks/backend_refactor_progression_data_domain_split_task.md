## Scope

Split `scripts/progression_data.gd` into character, weapon, reward, artifact, shop, ascension and balance-model data owners.

## Requirements

- Keep `ProgressionData` as compatibility facade.
- No balance changes.
- Move budget-only estimators out of production data where practical.
- Update docs references after split.

## Verification

- Runtime smoke and balance harness pass.
- Content registry consistency test passes after migration.

## Serialization

High conflict risk. Serialize after active balance/content tasks.
